# JED Starter App

Find extensions for your Joomla site in the Joomla Extensions Directory, the official directory for Joomla components, modules and plugins.

A JoomGap starter project to create a hybrid mobile app for Joomla! CMS, powered by Cordova/PhoneGap, AngularJS and Ionic.

This project is the product of many years of iterative development and
combined community knowledge from open source projects. It does not impose a specific development
philosophy or framework, so you're free to architect your code in the
way that you want.

## How to integrate JG Boilerplate with Joomla! CMS

JG Boilerplate includes [JoomGap Simple Library](https://github.com/JoomGap/JGSimple) to integrate Joomla! CMS.

A call to Joomla! can be simply implemented in this way:

	q = jgSimpleApi.get(url, params).$promise;
	q.then(function(response) {
		if ( (response) && (response.success) ) {
			console.log(response.data);
		}
	}
	
## Concerning to security measures

There are multiple security measures on browsers and server to prevent abuse. 

In a Cordoba/PhoneGap mobile app, a mobile brower speaks with a web server with Joomla! CMS. Then, there are at least three security layers:

- Mobile browser
- Web server
- Joomla! CMS

> JG Boilerplater is mainly oriented for development. So, a permissive security policy has been implemented.

### Production security policy

This is a checklist of security items to evaluate before publishing an app:

- Latest Cordoba/PhoneGap version
- Required plugins
- android:debuggable="false", to disable Android debugging
- Required device permissions
- [HTTP access control (CORS)](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/cors/)
	- access origin
- [Whitelist policy](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-whitelist#cordova-plugin-whitelist)	
	- allow-intent
	- allow-navigation
	- allow-intent 
- [Content-Security-Policy](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/security/content-security-policy/)
- AngularJS
	- $logProvider.debugEnabled(false);
	- $compileProvider.debugInfoEnabled(false);
	
### Joomla and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

The same security points have to be evaluated to allow access from a different security domain that the source site domain.

JG Boilerplate opens connections via [JSON-P](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP) to standard Joomla! sites. In [JoomGap Simple Library](https://github.com/JoomGap/JGSimple), connections are handled with [AngularJS $resource](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngResource/service/$resource).
